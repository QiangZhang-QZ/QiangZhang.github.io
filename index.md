As a post-doc research fellow in the [Closed-Loop Engineering for Advanced Rehabilitation (CLEAR)](https://www.clear-ncsu-unc.com/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University, my goal is to improve human mobility and health by developing human-centered control approaches for advanced wearable robotic devices. For doing so, I incoporate modern sensing techbologies and machine learning-based control algorithms to customized the assistance from wearable robotic devices for individual users, including healthy people and patients with neurological disorders.
<br/>
I received the B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering and M.S. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, in July 2014 and June 2017. I received my second M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, in July 2019. I received my Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from [Neuromuscular Control and Robotics Lab](http://www.sharmalabncsu.org/) at North Carolina State University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Raleigh, NC, in Nov. 2021. 
<br/>
Currently, I am working as a post-doc research fellow in two labs, the [Neuromuscular Rehabilitation Engineering Laboratory (NREL)](https://nrel.bme.unc.edu/) and the [Interdisciplinary Human Movement Research Lab](https://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/physical/research/interdisciplinary-human-movement-research-lab/). My research interests include sensor fusion-based human motion intent detection, robotic exoskeleton design and impedance control, machine learning-based control, nonlinear control, adaptive control, and neuromuscular signal processing and analysis.
