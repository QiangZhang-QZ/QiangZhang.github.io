As a post-doc research fellow in the Closed-Loop Engineering for Advanced Rehabilitation (CLEAR) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University, my goal is to improve human mobility and health by developing human-centered control approaches for advanced wearable robotic devices. For doing so, I incoporate modern sensing techbologies and machine learning-based control algorithms to customized the assistance from wearable robotic devices for individual users, including healthy people and patients with neurological disorders.

I received the B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering and M.S. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China, in 2014 and 2017. I received my second M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2019. I received my Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from North Carolina State University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Raleigh, NC, in 2021. My research interests include human intent detection, nonlinear control, adaptive control, exoskeleton design and impedance control, machine learning based control, sensor fusion, and biological signal processing and analysis.
