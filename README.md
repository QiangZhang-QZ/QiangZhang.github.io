I got my Ph.D. degree from the UNC/NCSU Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Nov. 2021. During my Ph.D. study, I was working under the supervision of Dr. Nitin Sharma in Neuromuscular Control and Robotics Lab. My research interests are in the areas of human motion intention detection, nonlinear control, adaptive control, impedance control, machine learning-based control, rehabilitative/assistive robots, exoskeleton, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), nonlinear observer, and sensor fusion.

My Ph.D. research efforts were on human ankle joint effort prediction by using ultrasound imaging and surface electromyography fusion, assist-as-needed control of ankle exoskeleton during walking, and NMES-elicited ankle joint trajectory tracking control with ultrasound imaging-based muscle state feedback. I have collaborated on iterative learning control of a lower limb hybrid neuroprosthesis for sit-to-stand task, as well as model predictive control of elbow joint by stimulating antagonistic muscles.

Prior to my Ph.D. program, I got my becholar and master degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering from Wuhan University, China. My research work during master study focused on 1) the development of a lower limb bipedal walking robot with four active degrees of freedom and feedforward adaptive control design for its walking on compliant ground surfance; 2) the development of an upper limb exoskeleton robot with four active degrees of freedom and two passive degrees of freedom and impedance control design to provide assistance when necessary. Each active DOF is actuated by a customized serial elastic actuator plus Bowden cable.

I have published my research work in various scientific peer-reviewed journals and conferences of IEEE, EMBS, IFAC, and ASME societies. I have been nominated as one finalist for the Best Student Paper Award at the 16th IEEE/RAS-EMBS International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR 2019).

My academic training and more than eight years of experience working as a research assistant in three labs prepare me to be an effective researcher in the areas of human-in-loop robotics, biomechanics analysis, control of biomechatronic devices, and so on. I am always looking for opportunities where I can combine my research acumen with my research experience to help real-world medical and daily needs.
